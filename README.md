# Make Change Project

## Description
This is my first Java project while at Skill Distillery. The goal of the project is to make a cash register of sorts. The user is prompted to enter an amount (cost) for an item, then the tender paid for the item. The amount of change is then calculated and printed by the denomination and amount of needed to make change from $20 to $.01. If the user enters a tender less than the amount (cost) of the item then an error message appears informing the user that the funds are insufficient.

## What I learned
I learned a lot about using the % operator and how to use if conditions to account for the possible outcomes. I don't like that my code is all under one method and would like to try coding this program with different methods to potentially make it easier to read. This was the most logical way to break down this assignment for me, however.

### Technologies used
